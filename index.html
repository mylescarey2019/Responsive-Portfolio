  <!-- Code assessment:
       Refactoring points of my Basic Portfolio solution to add responsiveness had some challenges as the Basic Porfolio code 
       is first HTML/CSS effort and while produces visual desired results it is full of room for improvement.
       This responsive version itself could be improved in addition to cleaning up the baggage present from the Basic Portfolio starting point.
       
       Features - Responsive:
       
        1. Two breakpoints - at 768px and 640px, margins present at all times
        2. Name/Nav section switches to full container width (stacked on each other) at the 640 breakpoint - above that they have margin
           and match the width of the body content (max 960px)
        3. Header is static at small breakpoint but currently a bit buggy (see next section below)
        4. At 960px the Portfolio page has three columns of projects
        5. Media query used to help better fit nav bar icons and footer icon attribution text
        
        
      Missing or pooly inplemented:
      
        1. Static header buggy at small breakpoint - behavior is that content scrolls under header for certain distance before the
           header and rest of content scroll up together.  Unsuccessful in debugging this so far.  Desired behavior can be seen in the
           Bootstrap version - i.e. header is static and whole page scrolls together 

        2. Portfolio - clumsy placement and ill-responsive behavior on some form factors - projects don't center are take up available space in some cases

        3. Code passed validation, but really need to refactor it for better techniques, better semantics and eliminating/redoing ids and classes

        4. In the footer the text for Icon attribution text got troublesome on smaller form factors so needed media query to rearange 

        5. Better comments needed throughout

        6. A proper README.md file is needed - looking into templates and ideas via google
        
      Possible enhancements:

        1. Want to move social media links off the nav bar to their one container on the body as they cause challenges at the smaller form factors

          I am an IT professional who loves solving problems through programming and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming has been a part of my life since first coding on a Commodore 64 as a teen. &nbsp;I moved on to learn Visual Basic by coding a graphical 
          Scrabble game to play-by-email with family and friends.</p>
        <p>
          I have been working with SQL, relational databases and Unix throughout my career.
          &nbsp;Now, I am excited about and embracing the challenges of learning web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time my two teenage daughters, wife and I enjoy camping on the Washington and Oregon coasts. I also enjoy reading world and military history, Astronomy (both night sky and solar observing) and watching the Seahawks.
